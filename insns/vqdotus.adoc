| `vd`  | output | vector of 32-bit signed accumulated dot products

[NOTE]
====
The vector-vector variant of `vqdotus` is not specified because it can be obtained by swapping the `vs1` and `vs2` operand of the `vqdotsu.vv` instruction.
====

Description::
`vqdotus` performs a partial dot product of a vector of 8-bit unsigned integers by a vector of 8-bit signed integers,
accumulating the partial sums into a vector of 32-bit signed integers.
+
Each 32-bit element of `vs2` is interpreted as a list of four 8-bit unsigned integer sub-elements;
the 32-bit element read from general purpose register `rs1` is interpreted as a list of four 8-bit signed integer sub-elements;
whereas each 32-bit element of `vd` is interpreted as a single 32-bit signed integer.
For each element taken consecutively from `vs2`,
the associated sub-element list is multiplied componentwise by the element list from `rs1`,
widening (with sign-extension) to 32 bits.
Finally, the four products are accumulated into the associated element of `vd`,
wrapping on signed overflow.

Operation::

--
function clause execute (VQDOTUS(vs2, vs1, vd)) = {
  foreach (i from vstart to vl-1) {
    // TODO sign extension
    let {a0 @ a1 @ a2 @ a3} : bits (4*8) = get_velem(vs2, i)
    let {b0 @ b1 @ b2 @ b3} : bits (4*8) = zext_or_truncate_to_sew(X(rs1));
    let acc : bits (SEW) = get_velem(vd, i);
    let res : bits (SEW) = a0 * b0 + a1 * b1 + a2 * b2 + a3 * b3 + acc;
    set_velem(vd, i, product);
  }
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
