Description::
`vqdotu` performs a partial dot product of two vectors of 8-bit unsigned integers,
accumulating the partial sums into a vector of 32-bit unsigned integers.
+
In the vector-vector (`.vv`) variant,
each 32-bit element of `vs1` and `vs2` is interpreted as a list of four 8-bit unsigned integer sub-elements,
whereas each 32-bit element of `vd` is interpreted as a single 32-bit unsigned integer.
For each pair of elements taken consecutively from `vs1` and `vs2`,
the associated sub-element lists are multiplied componentwise,
widening (with zero-extension) to 32 bits.
Finally, the four products are accumulated into the associated element of `vd`,
wrapping on unsigned overflow.
+
The vector-scalar (`.vx`) variant reuses a single 32-bit element,
read from integer register `rs1`, instead of a vector (`vs1`) of such elements.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
function clause execute (VQDOTU(vs2, vs1, vd, suffix)) = {
  foreach (i from vstart to vl-1) {
    // TODO sign extension
    let {a0 @ a1 @ a2 @ a3} : bits (4*8) = get_velem(vs2, i)
    let {b0 @ b1 @ b2 @ b3} : bits (4*8) = if suffix =="vv" then get_velem(vs1, i)
                          else zext_or_truncate_to_sew(X(rs1));
    let acc : bits (SEW) = get_velem(vd, i);
    let res : bits (SEW) = a0 * b0 + a1 * b1 + a2 * b2 + a3 * b3 + acc;
    set_velem(vd, i, product);
