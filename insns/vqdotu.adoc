Description::
`vqdotu` performs a partial dot product of two vectors of 8-bit unsigned integers,
accumulating the partial sums into a vector of 32-bit unsigned integers.
+
In the vector-vector (`.vv`) variant,
each 32-bit element of `vs1` and `vs2` is interpreted as a list of four 8-bit unsigned integer sub-elements,
whereas each 32-bit element of `vd` is interpreted as a single 32-bit unsigned integer.
For each pair of elements taken consecutively from `vs1` and `vs2`,
the associated sub-element lists are multiplied componentwise,
widening (with zero-extension) to 32 bits.
Finally, the four products are accumulated into the associated element of `vd`,
wrapping on unsigned overflow.
+
The vector-scalar (`.vx`) variant reuses a single 32-bit element,
read from integer register `rs1`, instead of a vector (`vs1`) of such elements.

Operation::
